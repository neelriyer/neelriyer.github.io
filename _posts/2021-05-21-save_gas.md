title: Minimize Gas in Your Smart Contracts
---

I went from paying excessive amounts in gas to paying a reasonable amount after doing a course on solidity development.

I'll tell you the main tricks here so you don't waste your time doing the entire [course](https://cryptozombies.io/).


# 1. Smaller uints

If you've got multiple uints inside a struct use a small-sized uint. This allows Solidity to use less storage.

Convert this:
```solidity
struct NormalStruct {
  uint a;
  uint b;
  uint c;
}

```

To this:
```solidity
struct MiniMe {
  uint32 a;
  uint32 b;
  uint c;
}
```

`MiniMe` will cost less gas than `NormalStruct` because of struct packing

# 2. View Functions Don't Cost You a Thing

View functions don't cost any gas when they're called externally by a user.

This is because view functions don't actually change anything on the blockchain â€“ they only read the data.

Wherever possible use a view function. Here's an example:

```solidity
# https://github.com/spiyer99/CryptoZombies/blob/master/contracts/zombie_helper.sol#L36

function getZombiesByOwner(address _owner) external view returns(uint[] memory) {
    uint[] memory result = new uint[](ownerZombieCount[_owner]);
    uint counter = 0;
    for (uint i = 0; i < zombies.length; i++) {
      if (zombieToOwner[i] == _owner) {
        result[counter] = i;
        counter++;
      }
    }
    return result;
  }

```

This function allows us to find all the zombies that someone owns. 

We do this by iterating through all the zombies. 

Yes this is naive. We could simply create a hash map. 

But it's also cheap. So it's better.

# Conclusion

And that's it! These two things saved me a considerable amount of gas. I hope they help you too.

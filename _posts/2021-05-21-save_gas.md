title: Minimize Gas in Your Smart Contracts
---

I was able to considerable reduce the gas I pay in smart contract development with a few tricks. I learned these from a [course on solidity development](https://cryptozombies.io/).

I'll share thet tricks with you here so you don't have to waste your time doing the entire [course](https://cryptozombies.io/).


# 1. Smaller uints

If you have multiple uints inside a struct, using a smaller-sized uint when possible will allow Solidity to pack these variables together to take up less storage. 

Convert this:
```solidity
struct NormalStruct {
  uint a;
  uint b;
  uint c;
}

```

To this:
```solidity
struct MiniMe {
  uint32 a;
  uint32 b;
  uint c;
}
```

`MiniMe` will cost less gas than `NormalStruct` because of struct packing

#2. View functions don't cost you a thing

View functions don't cost any gas when they're called externally by a user.

This is because view functions don't actually change anything on the blockchain â€“ they only read the data.

Wherever possible use a view function. Here's an example:

```solidity
# https://github.com/spiyer99/CryptoZombies/blob/master/contracts/zombie_helper.sol#L36

function getZombiesByOwner(address _owner) external view returns(uint[] memory) {
    uint[] memory result = new uint[](ownerZombieCount[_owner]);
    uint counter = 0;
    for (uint i = 0; i < zombies.length; i++) {
      if (zombieToOwner[i] == _owner) {
        result[counter] = i;
        counter++;
      }
    }
    return result;
  }

```

This function allows us to find all the zombies that someone owns. 

We do this by iterating through all the zombies. 

Yes this is naive. We could simply create a hash map. 

But it's also cheap. So it's better.

# Conclusion

And that's it! These two things saved me a considerable amount of gas. I hope they help you too.

# TLDR

I've created a dataset for training film restoration models. 

The video above shows a sample of the dataset. On the left is a video of a great star wars scene. On the right is the same video made crappier. 

I've added cue marks, scratches to the film and generally just made the things worse. Enjoy!

# Why did I do this?

Properly cleaned data is not as abundant as people make it out to be.

I've been trying to restore the star wars deleted scenes for some time now. My attempts have been far from perfect. 

Recently I thought that if I release the dataset, maybe, just maybe someone out there could train a better model. Thanks in advance, kind stranger!

Making this dataset wasn't easy. It took me some time to figure it out. I hope this is useful for people. 

Here's the dataset: [https://www.kaggle.com/spiyer/old-film-restoration-dataset/](https://www.kaggle.com/spiyer/old-film-restoration-dataset/)

Please let me know if this was useful on [twitter](https://twitter.com/neeliyer11). I'm just trying this out.
